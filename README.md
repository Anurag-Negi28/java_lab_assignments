# Java Lab Assignments
This repository contains Java programs with proper comments.

- [**hello_java.java**](hello_java.java): This program adds two numbers by making a function `add`.

- [**fibbonacci.java**](fibbonacci.java): This Java program calculates and prints the Fibonacci series up to a specified number of terms. The Fibonacci series is a sequence of numbers where each number is the sum of the two preceding ones.

- [**largest_number.java**](largest_number.java): This program finds the largest of three numbers.

- [**question1.java**](question1.java): This program statement accepts ten students' marks in an array and arranges them in ascending order, converts them into grades, and prints marks and grades in a tabular form.

- [**question2.java**](question2.java): This program accepts three digits (0-9) and prints all their possible combinations.

- [**question3.java**](question3.java): Write a Java program to accept ten numbers in an array and compute the square of each number. Print the sum of these numbers.

- [**question4.java**](question4.java): This Java program accepts ten numbers in an array and computes the square of each number. Print the sum of these numbers.

- [**question5.java**](question5.java): This program finds the sum of all integers greater than 40 and less than 250 that are divisible by 5.

- [**SuperClass.java**](SuperClass.java): This Java program shows that the private member of a super class cannot be accessed from derived classes.

- [**Main.java**](Main.java): Main class of SuperClass.

- [**Worker.java**](Worker.java): Class Worker derives classes DailyWorker and SalariedWorker from it. Every worker has a name and a salary rate. Write method ComPay (int hours) to compute the week pay of every worker. A DailyWorker is paid on the basis of the number of days he/she works. The SalariedWorker gets paid the wage for 40 hours a week, no matter what the actual hours are. Test this program to calculate the pay of workers.

- [**Must.java**](Must.java): Main class of Worker class.
