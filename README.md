# Java Lab Assignments
This repo contains java programs with proper comments 
<h3>hello_java.java</h3>
This program adds two numbers by making a function add
<h3>fibbonacci.java</h3>
 This Java program calculates and prints the Fibonacci series up to a specified number of terms.
 The Fibonacci series is a sequence of numbers where each number is the sum of the two preceding ones.
 <h3>largest_number.java</h3>
 This program finds the largest of three numbers
 <h3>question1.java</h3>
  This program statement accepts ten students marks in an array and arrange in ascending <br> order, convert into grades and print marks and grades in tabular form.
<h3>question2.java</h3>
This program accepts three digits(0-9) and print all its possible combination
<h3>question3.java</h3>
Write a Java program to accept ten numbers in an array and compute the square of each number.<br> Print the sum of these numbers.
<h3>question4.java</h3>
This Java program accept ten numbers in an array and compute the square of each number.<br> Print the sum of these numbers.
<h3>question5.java</h3>
 This program finds the sum of all integers greater than 40 and less than 250 that are divisible by 5.
<h3>SuperClass.java</h3>
This Java program shows that private member of a super class cannot be
accessed from derived classes
  <h4>main.java</h4>
  main class of SuperClass
<h3>Worker.java</h3>
Class Worker derives classes DailyWorker and SalariedWorker from
it. Every worker has a name and a salary rate. Write method ComPay (int hours)
to compute the week pay of every worker. A DailyWorker is paid on the basis of
the number of days he/she works. The SalariedWorker gets paid the wage for 40
hours a week, no matter what the actual hours are. Test this program to calculate
the pay of workers
  <h4>must.java</h4>
  main class of Worker class
